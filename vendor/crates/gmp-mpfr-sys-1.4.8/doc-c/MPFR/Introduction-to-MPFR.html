<p>MPFR is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision arithmetic
on floating-point numbers. It is based on the GNU MP library.
It aims to provide a class of floating-point numbers with
precise semantics. The main characteristics of MPFR, which make it differ
from most arbitrary precision floating-point software tools, are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the MPFR code is portable, i.e., the result of any operation
does not depend on the machine word size
<code>mp_bits_per_limb</code> (64 on most current processors), possibly
except in faithful rounding.
It does not depend either on the machine rounding mode or rounding precision;
</li><li> the precision in bits can be set <em>exactly</em> to any valid value
for each variable (including very small precision);
</li><li> MPFR provides the four rounding modes from the IEEE&nbsp;754-1985
standard, plus away-from-zero, as well as for basic operations as for other
mathematical functions. Faithful rounding (partially supported) is provided
too, but the results may no longer be reproducible.
</li></ul>
<p>In particular, with a precision of 53 bits and in any of the four standard
rounding modes, MPFR is able to
exactly reproduce all computations with double-precision machine
floating-point numbers (e.g., <code>double</code> type in C, with a C
implementation that rigorously follows Annex F of the ISO C99 standard
and <code>FP_CONTRACT</code> pragma set to <code>OFF</code>) on the four arithmetic
operations and the square root, except the default exponent range is much
wider and subnormal numbers are not implemented (but can be emulated).
</p>
<p>This version of MPFR is released under the GNU Lesser General Public
License, version 3 or any later version.
It is permitted to link MPFR to most non-free programs, as long as when
distributing them the MPFR source code and a means to re-link with a
modified MPFR library is provided.

<p>Everyone should read <a href="constant.MPFR_Basics.html#MPFR-Basics">MPFR Basics</a>.  If you need to install the library
yourself, you need to read <a href="constant.Installing_MPFR.html#start">Installing MPFR</a>, too.
To use the library you will need to refer to <a href="constant.MPFR_Interface.html#MPFR-Interface">MPFR Interface</a>.
</p>
<p>The rest of the manual can be used for later reference, although it is
probably a good idea to glance through it.
