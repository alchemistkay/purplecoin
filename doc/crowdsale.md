* Only coins sold in the crowdsale will be emitted in the smart contract. Developers will not be able to sell or access coins before the mainnet launch.
* Coins are transferred to the main chain by burning them on Ethereum and including the receiving Purplecoin address in the transaction.
* The sale is hosted at https://sale.purplecoin.io
* The Metamask browser extension is required to participate.

### How to participate
* First create a [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download/) wallet if you don't already have one.
* Transfer at least 0.25 ETH to your Metamask wallet. We recommend 0.26 ETH min to account for transaction fees.
* Visit https://sale.purplecoin.io and follow the instructions.
* Once the KYC verification is complete, you must wait for the sale to end.
* Once the sale has ended, you can generate a Purplecoin address and transfer your XPU to the main chain.

### KYC Escrow
All funds are held in escrow in the crowdsale smart contract until a beneficiary's identity has been confirmed. The beneficiary is able to refund their purchase if their identity verification failed.

### Cold storage
Raised funds are kept in a 3 of 5 multi-sig setup with keys being stored at different compounds which we will not disclose the location or any other details of.

### Fund allocation
This is how we plan to allocate the raised funds:
* 50% will be used to fund the foundation responsible for governing post-launch.
* 25% to pre-launch development/marketing/bounties.
* 25% kept in reserve for unforeseen circumstances.
