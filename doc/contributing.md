## Contributing to Purplecoin
If you wish to contribute to Purplecoin, you are more than welcome. This is a guideline on how to do so and what we are looking for at the moment.

### How can I contribute?
* Core Development (Rust) - If you are skilled and wish to leave your mark on the project, the best way is to contribute to the Core protocol directly. See the [Technical Roadmap](https://github.com/purpleprotocol/purplecoin/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for tasks that need to be completed.
* GUI Development (Rust) - Contributing to the wallet GUI will ensure the community has the best experience possible.
* Front-end development (React/HTML/CSS) - Any help on the web part of the project is very welcome. Any contributions to this part will ensure the project website is smooth and can serve the needs of the community. 
* Marketing/Outreach - Any help and suggestions in this regard is always welcome.

### Are there any contributor rewards?
Prior to mainnet launch, contributors will be rewarded on a case by case basis according to the level of their contribution at mainnet launch. Message #octavonce on our Discord for details.

Once the mainnet is launched, worthy contributors will be sponsored by the Purplecoin Foundation.

### How can I start?
