## Purplecoin Tokenomics
This document describes token economics for Purplecoin. Please note that the following values, except the amount of pre-mined coins which are distributed across all shards, apply for each shard.
* Total supply before tail emission: 2,379,201,281 XPU
* Pre-mined coins: 228,802,307 XPU
* Block time: 30 seconds
* Initial block reward: 16 XPU per sector, with 16 sectors, 256 XPU is created every 30 seconds
* Halving period: 4.2 million blocks (4 years).
* Total halvings: 20 halvings after which tail emission of 0.00006103 XPU applies indefinitely

### Token utility
The growth of the token is dependant upon its utility. As Purplecoin is made to first and foremost, sustain other assets built on top. The role of XPU is to pay the miners fees for validating transactions. However, as Purplecoin has a mechanism which allows exhanging any asset built on top during the same transaction, it is not necessary to own XPU in order to benefit from its utility. We can then calculate the transaction fees in the asset that is being sent, instead of XPU.

We can then say that from a user's perspective, XPU is completely abstracted. Purplecoin can be used as the backend of any digital asset/token, without being presented to the user.

## Token economy
We can see with this model that the value of XPU is directly dependant upon the number of applications/assets built on top. As demand increases, so does the value and vice-versa. It is the oil that powers the Purplecoin platform.

### High distribution
XPU is highly distributed both in the crowdsale (via a low individual cap), and at the mining level. It should be close impossible for a single miner to receive the whole reward for all shards at once. This is because each shard has a different required PoW algorithm at any individual moment. A miner would have to hold a large proportion of the hashrate of all PoW algorithms (GR, Sha256, Blake2, Fugue, JH, etc) in order to receive the whole reward.

Miner monopolies are much harder to attain in Purplecoin. First-class support for decentralised mining pools is also included.
